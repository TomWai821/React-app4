This iNotebook website made with MERN stack(MongoDB for database, Express.js for backend, React.js for frontend and Node.js for server environment)

And there are 3 pages(Registration, Login and the main page)

In this project, i am using Restful API to communicate with MongoDB(NoSQL database) in express.js(backend side) to complete CRUD operations(note and user)
Use jwt(Json web token) to protect the object id, bcrypt to protect the password(generate salt to hash the password)

Using Node.js for setup the server(Such as listening port, id, sql connection)

And using React.js to manage the frontend rendering
For example: 
Using useEffect, useState, fetch, react-router-dom to rendering user login/logout. 
Using useContext(include provider), useState, useRef, fetch to manage the rendering of Notes.
